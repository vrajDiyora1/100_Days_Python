## Day 2: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

#### Purpose
>Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.



#### Problem Statement
> Consider the number of unique elements in nums to be k​​​​​​​​​​​​​​. After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements k.

The first k elements of nums should contain the unique numbers in sorted order. The remaining elements beyond index k - 1 can be ignored.





#### Step by Step
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

#### Code
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
            
        i= 1

        for j in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] != nums[i-1]:
                nums[i] = nums[j]
                i += 1

        return i
